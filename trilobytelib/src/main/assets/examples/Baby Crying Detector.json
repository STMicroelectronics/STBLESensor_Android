"notes":"The Baby Crying Detector (BCD) app implements the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) and an AI (Artificial Intelligence) processing to detect if a baby is crying using the MEMS microphone MP23ABS1 of the SensorTile.box at 16KHz os sample frequency.
The analysis of the acquired audio is based on the FFT of the signal, processed by the MCU which calculates the MEL FFT and the MFCC.
This parameters are sent to the implemented MCU neural network which outputs the state of baby crying/not-crying with a warning on the phone screen.
The neural network is classified as a deep feed forward neural network.
The network structure is composed from 2 hidden nodes of 100 neurons each.",
