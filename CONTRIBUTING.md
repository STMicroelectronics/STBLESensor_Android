STMicroelectronics is happy to receive contributions from the community, based on an initial Contributor License Agreement (CLA) procedure.

* If you are an individual writing original source code and you are sure you own the intellectual property, then you need to sign an Individual CLA (https://cla.st.com).
* If you work for a company that wants also to allow you to contribute your work, your company needs to provide a Corporate CLA (https://cla.st.com) mentioning your GitHub account name.
* If you’re not sure that a CLA (Individual or Corporate) has been signed for your GitHub account you can check here (https://cla.st.com). Please note that Corporate CLA will always take precedence over Individual CLA.


Please note that:

* The Corporate CLA will always take precedence over the Individual CLA.
* One CLA submission is sufficient for any project proposed by STMicroelectronics.
